💻 I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in Javascript, React-Redux, and Ruby on Rails.

👩‍💻 Check out my most recent project, Off the Beaten Path! It's a clone of Alltrails.com. It is a fully functional site where those looking to get outdoors can explore trails, including trail maps, and national parks. A search feature is also included

🍎 I also enjoyed making Teacher's Pet, a Teacher's aide that generates personalized student reviews in under 30 seconds.

❤️ I'm a policy freak and a polyglot (English, Dutch, German, French), and in my free time, I love to strum the banjo.

💬 Ask me about how my policy background contributes to software engineering!
